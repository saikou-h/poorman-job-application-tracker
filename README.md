# poorman-job-application-tracker
An easy but useful tracker that helps you organize what job applications you have submitted.

## Motivation
Track my job applications. Organize companies/positions/work type etc. 


## How to use
It's a very broken but I still find it useful. You need to have Python installed and you will need to put main.py, main.ui and a spreadsheet Tracker.xlsx in the same directory. The Tracker.xlsx needs to have the header ready in the following order: No., Company Name, Position, Work Type, Location, Salary Range, Application Submitted, Submission Date, Source, Note. There is a sample spreadsheet in the repository for your reference and you will have to remove the affix so the file name is "Tracker.xlsx". You can add more columns after them but they will not be handled by this tracker.

You use this by running main.py and you will (hopefully) see the GUI below:

You enter the information (they are all considered strings to be written into the spreadsheet) then click "Add" at the bottom. The tracker will insert the entry to the spreadsheet as below:

The position can have a linked embedded so you can click that and remind yourself what kind of role it is.


## What I have to say
Sorry I didn't have the luxury of time making this a fancy one. I need to spend my energy looking for my next job to keep the food on the table for my family. Please feel free to improve this at your own will. Good luck to all of ourselves. We will not lose and we will have our triumph!
